This project is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit that collects and analyzes e-commerce data from a sandbox website. The application scrapes product information, customer testimonials, and reviews, then processes and cleans the collected data before applying sentiment analysis to customer reviews using a Hugging Face Transformer model.
Through an interactive sidebar, users can navigate between different data views, filter customer reviews by month for the year 2023, and examine the distribution of positive and negative sentiments along with the model’s confidence scores. The application is deployed as a live web service and showcases a complete end-to-end data workflow, including web scraping, data preprocessing, NLP-driven sentiment analysis, data visualization, and cloud deployment.
